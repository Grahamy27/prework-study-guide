# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

The thing that motivated me to get into coding was that I had a few ideas for projects but had zero knowledge of coding.
I built this project to keep all my notes together to help me progress through my course.
It solves the problem of me trying to locate notes and what I have done and keeps it all easily accessible.
I have learnt many valuable ways to incorporate coding into my saved project.

## Usage

I can review notes in each section, such as notes about a certain topic, like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git. And if we open the DevTools console, we can see the JavaScript running. It will list the topics we learned from prework and choose one topic for us to study first.
